# This GitHub Action workflow triggers in two scenarios - 
# 1. When a push is made to the main branch
# 2. When a pull request is either opened, synchronized, reopened,
#    or closed, and the target is the main branch. If the change
#    is just to the podcast_audio file, then it is ignored.

# The workflow has several phases. Phases 1, 2 and 3 run on a push, or if the pull request activity
# type is not 'closed'.
#
# 1.  A validation phase, which is split into two separate jobs that run in parallel.
# 1.1 A set of steps that compress images
# 1.2 A set of steps that lint the markdown contents of the website
#
# 2.  Build the Static Website by using the Hugo CLI.
#
# 3.  Deploy the website to Azure Static Web Apps
# 3.1 If the workflow was triggered by a pull request (not a closed activity), then publish the static assets
#     to the static web app. This is associated with the GitHub Actions staging.azure environment.
# 3.2 If the workflow was triggered by a push to main, then publish the static assets to the static
#     web app. This is associated with the GitHub Actions production.azure environment, so requires manual approval.
#
# 4   If the workflow was triggered by a Pull Request close event, then close the staging sites which are open.

# Environment variables used for consistency across the workflow.

Thanks for helping make Cloud With Chris a safe browsing experience for everyone.

## Security

Chris takes the security of the Cloud With Chris website seriously, including the [Hugo Creator Theme](https://github.com/CloudWithChris/cloudwithchris.com).

The site is based on Static Content. This means that there are no identities (Authentication / Authorization) or backend databases to worry about. As a result, this means the attack surface area is smaller, so there are fewer things to worry about.

Even so, there are several recommended practices that can be adopted. Content Security Policies are built-in to the Hugo Creator theme. CodeQL and other static analysis tools are adopted throughout the repositories. However, things can always slip through. If you spot anything, please get in touch.

# Cloud with Chris

This is my quick fix.

Exploring Cloud concepts with [Chris Reddington](https://www.cloudwithchris.com/) (Welsh Tech Geek, Cloud Advocate, Musical Theatre Enthusiast and Improving Improviser!). We will regularly invite guests to talk about their experiences with the cloud and hear about some of the lessons learned around their cloud journey.

There are several series for you to tune in and watch/listen in for -

* **Architecting for the Cloud One Pattern at a Time** - A series focused entirely around Cloud Architecture. This could be Cloud Design Patterns, foundational architectural concepts, requirements driven discussions and more. Have something architectural to discuss? Then this is likely the series for you!
* **Cloud Drops** - Not everyone can afford 30+ minutes of time to listen to a podcast or YouTube video. That's why we're making Cloud Drops, a new series focused all around bite-sized content - Less than 5 minutes long!
* **Cloud Gaming Notes** - Many of us have grown up with gaming in one form of another. But have you ever thought about what it takes to host a game in the #Cloud​? Well, this is the series for you! On the first Wednesday of every month, we explore Cloud Concepts that impact your journey to a connected multiplayer #gaming​ experience!
* **CNCF Projects** - We've all heard of Kubernetes. Perhaps you've heard about Prometheus? But what about KEDA, Helm, Rook, Chaos Mesh and more? In this series, I'll explore the numerous projects that exist as part of the Cloud Native Compute Foundation landscape.
* **Community Gaming** - Join members of the cloud community as they talk through what’s top of mind, the latest trends, and have a bit of fun in a game or two! This takes place on the first Wednesday of each month.

  Want to participate? Then jump onto the [Cloud With Chris Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/9FJctHP9Zv) and assign yourself the gamers role on the #role-assign channel!
* **Main Podcast Series** - This is where Cloud with Chris originated, content without any particular theme or agenda! If you can't find a series that fits with what you want to talk about - That's okay! You may be interested in following the "main" track!
* **Tales from the Real World** - Technology is great, but sometimes when we apply it to real world scenarios there can be challenges. There might be people/process challenges, or issues trying to bring different types of technology together. We also need to make considerations around security and many other cross-cutting concerns. This is less about the theory, and the technology - focusing more on the stories and the lessons learned from the real world. Not just on technology implementations/projects, but also understanding the journey of folks through their careers and more.
* **Tech Roundup** - Chris provides a regular update on what's going on in Azure, Azure DevOps and GitHub from a technology and community perspective. He also updates on the recent and upcoming items on Cloud With Chris! Want to stay up to date? Then this is the series for you!
* **ToolUp Tuesday** - ToolUp Tuesday is all about showing the thought process and decisions made when creating an application. Join Chris and Matt as they build a new application from the ground up, including development processes, tooling, service choices and architectural decisions!

## Hugo Creator Theme.

The Cloud With Chris site uses the [Hugo Creator](https://github.com/CloudWithChris/hugo-creator) theme. It started as a dedicated theme for my Cloud With Chris in Jan 2021. In Jan 2022, I recognised that this could be useful to other content creators that may also be using Hugo. I had additional ideas for the site's functionality, but I hadn't focused on building the codebase in a sustainable way. Contributing to the OSS community gave me the push to refactor the site, and ensure it is readable, modular and scalable - putting it in a position to accept external contributions.

Prior to my own design, I used [Matt Stratton](http://github.com/mattstratton/)'s  [Hugo Castanet](https://github.com/mattstratton/castanet). A big thank you to Matt for his early coaching in contributing to his project, and for the inspiration for this theme.

## Thanks

Thank you to all of my guests for their ongoing support. Your great insights and discussions in Cloud With Chris help add an incredible amount of variety and interest to the show!

# Cloud with Chris

Exploring Cloud concepts with [Chris Reddington](https://www.cloudwithchris.com/) (Welsh Tech Geek, Cloud Advocate, Musical Theatre Enthusiast and Improving Improviser!). We will regularly invite guests to talk about their experiences with the cloud and hear about some of the lessons learned around their cloud journey.

There are several series for you to tune in and watch/listen in for -

* **Architecting for the Cloud One Pattern at a Time** - A series focused entirely around Cloud Architecture. This could be Cloud Design Patterns, foundational architectural concepts, requirements driven discussions and more. Have something architectural to discuss? Then this is likely the series for you!
* **Cloud Drops** - Not everyone can afford 30+ minutes of time to listen to a podcast or YouTube video. That's why we're making Cloud Drops, a new series focused all around bite-sized content - Less than 5 minutes long!
* **Cloud Gaming Notes** - Many of us have grown up with gaming in one form of another. But have you ever thought about what it takes to host a game in the #Cloud​? Well, this is the series for you! On the first Wednesday of every month, we explore Cloud Concepts that impact your journey to a connected multiplayer #gaming​ experience!
* **Main Podcast Series** - This is where Cloud with Chris originated, content without any particular theme or agenda! If you can't find a series that fits with what you want to talk about - That's okay! You may be interested in following the "main" track!
* **Tales from the Real World** - Technology is great, but sometimes when we apply it to real world scenarios there can be challenges. There might be people/process challenges, or issues trying to bring different types of technology together. We also need to make considerations around security and many other cross-cutting concerns. This is less about the theory, and the technology - focusing more on the stories and the lessons learned from the real world. Not just on technology implementations/projects, but also understanding the journey of folks through their careers and more.

## Thanks

Thank you to all of my guests for their ongoing support. Your great insights and disussions in Cloud With Chris help add an incredible amount of variety and interest to the show!

A big thank you also to [Matt Stratton](http://github.com/mattstratton/), who buit the [Hugo Castanet](https://github.com/mattstratton/castanet) theme that was being used on the site for some time. The recent CloudWithChris redesign borrows some of the foundational structures of the Hugo Castanet theme (e.g. episode markdown structures, RSS feed generation), to ensure continuity from moving from the Castanet theme into the rebranded Cloud With Chris site.

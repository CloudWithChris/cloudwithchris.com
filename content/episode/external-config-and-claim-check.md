Description: "How often do you think about the configuration of your applications across environments/regions/deployment boundaries? What if that configuration was stored somewhere externally but centralised, to make management easier? That's the idea behind the external config pattern! How about another scenario - What about those times where you've wanted to use a messaging service, but your payload is too big? Thought about externalising that payload too? Well, that's the Claim-check pattern! Join Peter and Chris as they talk about both of these patterns in this episode of Cloud with Chris!"

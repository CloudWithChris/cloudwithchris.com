Description: Imagine the scenario. You're a developer and you need to go and build
  some code. You need to install a number of dependencies, a code editor and perhaps
  a number of frameworks, only to find the code still doesn't compile on your machine.
  Probably because you're missing some frameworks or libraries. We've all been there.
  But perhaps, we don't have to be there. Stick around in this episode as we talk
  about Visual Studio Code, The Remote Containers Extension and GitHub Codespaces
  and how all of these can help solve that challenge.

In this episode, we're going to be taking a slight detour away from GitHub actions and focus on some of the announcements from GitHub universe last week. We're going to explore them both from the announcements, and also take a look at some of those features that have already been released. Stay tuned!

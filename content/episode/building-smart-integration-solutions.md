Hello, and welcome back to Cloud with Chris! You're with me, Chris Reddington - and we'll be talking about all things Cloud!

I hope that you're keeping safe and well in these strange times that we're going through! You may have noticed a drop off on my episodes over the recent weeks and months. I've had to take some time away to focus on my own health, but all is good and I'm looking forward to getting a rhythm going again with these podcast episodes!

So as always, if you have topic suggestions, or you want to come and talk with me in an episode - Please just let me know! You can find more info online at [www.cloudwithchris.com](www.cloudwithchris.com)

Now onto this episode! When we think about cloud, we typically think about distributed systems and somehow bringing those different components or systems together, so integrating them. But what are the common practices, or common challenges? You've probably heard of serverless, how does that fit into things? Well, I'm pleased to be joined by Ezhilarasi Chezhiyan, Product Consultant of Serverless360 at Kovai.co.

So, without further ado - let's go ahead and jump straight in.

**Show notes to follow at a later stage**

There we go, plenty to take in Logic Apps, Azure Functions, Event Grid, Service Bus and more. Serverless technologies are a great way to build out your distributed applications. We learned that they can be reactive or event driven, which can lead us towards cost efficiencies, and only paying for what we need, rather than compute on an ongoing basis.

We also heard a about some of the potential challenges when operating these types of solutions, including distributed monitoring and considerations about message handling. If you haven't already, it's well worth taking a look at the Azure Architecture Centre to understand how some of the patterns that we talked about fit into a serverless solution.

As always, thank you so much for listening - your support and engagement is the reason that I do these podcasts. I'd love to hear from you. Is there a topic you'd like me to talk about, or someone you'd like me to chat with? Do you have particular questions you want to hear answered? Let me know through the website [www.cloudwithchris.com](www.cloudwithchris.com), and I'll be sure to put those onto the backlog so we can plan those in. And while you're here - Don't forget to like or subscribe across my different platforms and social media channels. Thank you once again, and until next time… Goodbye!

Title = "21 - The Queue Based Load Leveling and Competing Consumers Pattern"
Description = "Do you have an application with some specific requirements around scalability, and continuity of service? What happens if your service is hit by heavy load? Could performance/reliability issues cause an impact to your solution? This is where both the queue-based load leveling and competing consumers patterns shine. Tune in and listen to Chris speak with Will Eastbury as they discuss both of these patterns. This is another episode in the series of Architecting for the Cloud, one pattern at a time."

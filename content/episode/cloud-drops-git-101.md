Description: "Have you ever had a scenario where you need to maintain versions of a set of files? Or have you needed to collaborate on files with colleagues in some way? That's a common scenario for developers, infrastructure engineers or data scientists/developers. It's an increasingly common problem. Some people solve this using   file shares or FTP Servers with numerous files, v1, v2, v2-final, but that doesn't scale and is quite a messy approach. Surely there is a better way? That's where a Version Control System can really help you. One such option is Git. Git is a distributed version control system, which means that rather than relying on a central location to host and store the entire set of files and history, each machine has a full version of the codebase and history locally. This means each user can be productive locally and independently on their own machine. Git is also optimised to be very lightweight and perfomant."

Enterprise agility—the ability to adapt fast and seize new opportunities while reducing costs—is critical for an organization to survive and thrive in this evolving digital age. While the rewards of bringing about agile transformation are significant, how many companies really achieve key results? Did you know the success rate is less than 10%? Even organizations that follow various agile methodologies do not adhere to them across the board, resulting in what’s known as agile-waterfall or wagile approaches.

Is there a pragmatic way to become truly agile? Yes, by embracing programmability. This approach goes beyond infrastructure automation, which is a common practice, by enabling programmatic access to automate actions, procedures, processes, and runtimes used in an application’s entire lifecycle. With programmability and end-to-end automation, teams can increase productivity and flexibility and quickly decommission repeatable tasks; they can also spend more time on implementing innovative ideas.

Asanka will share his experience from applying programmability in successful projects delivered iteratively, rapidly and in a timely way. In addition to the associated lean methodology, he will discuss a supportive reference architecture.

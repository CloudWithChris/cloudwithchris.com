Title = "3 - DevOps in a Cloud World"
Description = "In this episode, I'm very fortunate to have my first guest come and join me! And what better way to kick this off, than a topic area which is very close to my own heart - DevOps. I'm very excited that I was able to invite Abel Wang, Principal Developer Advocate and DevOps lead to come and join me to talk of his experiences at Microsoft. We jump through a few different areas, from What is DevOps, how it links back to requirements, Data DevOps and shifting left. There's plenty to learn from in this one, so let's dive straight in!"

In this episode, I'm very fortunate to have my first guest come and join me! And what better way to kick this off, than a topic area which is very close to my own heart - DevOps. I'm very excited that I was able to invite Abel Wang, Principal Developer Advocate and DevOps lead to come and join me to talk of his experiences at Microsoft. We jump through a few different areas, from What is DevOps, how it links back to requirements, Data DevOps and shifting left. There's plenty to learn from in this one, so let's dive straight in!

** More coming TBC **

Wow, what a whistle stop tour that was! We covered many different topics, and as always - it was an absolute pleasure to chat with Abel! If you have any follow-on thoughts, or want to continue the discussion - please get in touch either on Facebook or Twitter @CloudWithChris!If you enjoyed this session, please do let me know - so I can arrange for similar topics in the future, potentially even covering some of those topic areas in further  depth. We have a growing backlog of guests and ideas coming in, but I'm always looking for more! If you'd like speak on the show, please complete the form up at cloudwithchris.com and I'll be in touch!

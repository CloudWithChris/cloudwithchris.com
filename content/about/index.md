Chris is  trying his hand at a new skill, improv! He recently attended an intensive workshop with The Showstoppers, and is continuing to refine his skills with What's the game Improv! His vision is to merge the two areas together, and take part in more Musical Improv - though this is a slow work in progress, with thanks to COVID-19!

Simon has been working as a .NET developer for over 16 years now in a variety of industries including government, retail and manufacturing. He's been hacking around with computer code since he was old enough to read his Dad's copy of the ZX Spectrum BASIC coders manual.

Simon has been speaking about Functional C# at various user groups and conferences around the UK, USA, Europe and Australia and is particularly interested in seeing just how far C# can be pushed without breaking it.

Simon is currently working on a book for O'Reilly publications about functional programming with C#. Expected to appear in bookshops some time in 2023.

When he's not coding, or running after his two small children, he has been known to enjoy the classic series of Doctor Who, Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks, Cryptic Crosswords, and rather more coffee than is probably good for him.

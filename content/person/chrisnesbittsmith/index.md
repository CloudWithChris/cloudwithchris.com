A developer at heart with a passion for testing, while still active in the open source community. Chris been using and abusing Kubernetes since 0.4 in production, in government, for citizen facing services; he's worked extensively in critical national infrastructure where "matters of life or death" is not just a flippant throwaway comment.

Chris provides training and consulting to many UK & US Government departments, large multinational private sector enterprises, and large charities. Through all of this Chris has seen a lot of organizational and technical disfunction (not all of his own making) and in inefficiencies, and wants to join him in fixing them

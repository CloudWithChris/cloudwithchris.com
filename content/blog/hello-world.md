Surely, a "Hello World" post is a right of passage for technical bloggers?

Welcome to my blog, and of course - My first blog post! But first, who am I? I'm Christian Reddington (in case you couldn't tell by the domain name, or site title!) - and I'm a technology enthusiast (Read: Geek/Nerd, delete as appropriate). I have a development background and have most recently been involved within Microsoft Azure projects lately.

Over time, I intend to write posts on a number of topics. These will range from technical topics (things that I have learnt throughout my role and in my spread time!), in addition to things which interest me - Personal Development, Music, Innovation and More!

Now, being completely truthful - I'll admit that this is not my first blog post. I began writing a blog back in University on my final year project, but didn't have the dedication to carry it on. Since being in full time employment for a number of years, I felt it was about time to start writing again, and let the creative juices flow.

That's about it for now. I haven't completely figured out my posting schedule/rhythm yet, but I'm sure this will follow, after the first few posts. Stay tuned!

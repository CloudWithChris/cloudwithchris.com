Over the past few weeks, I have been working on a number of projects relating to Azure.

The usual theme has crept up, around recommended practices, and where to go for documentation. There are a couple of great resources to be aware of:

Azure Best Practice Checklists and Guidance

-   There are a number of best practice checklists available on the Azure.com website. Navigate to the Documentation Tab, and find the Best Practice subsection. You can find a number of different checklists, to use against your own solution!

Azure Cloud Design Practices Infographic

-   There is an [especially good infographic available](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/infographics/cloud-design-patterns/), containing 24 recommended patterns and practices from the perspectives of availability, data management, design and implementation, messaging, management and monitoring, performance and scalability, resilience and security. I actually have an A3 laminated copy of this, and is a great lookup tool!

Search the Azure Article Documentation

-   If all else fails, you could always use the Azure.com documentation. But there is plenty of it! Did you know that you can navigate to [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/), and search the documentation by a number of factors? For example, you can see below that I am looking for Best Practices relating to Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates.


Hope that these quick tips have been useful - Please let me know over Twitter if you think there are any other useful pieces to call out!

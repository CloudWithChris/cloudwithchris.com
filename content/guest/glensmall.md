I've spent that last 25 years working in software development, database design, data science, solution architecture and cloud migrations. In my career I've build numerous teams and capabilities, most recently helping to build the FastTrack for Azure team at Microsoft. I now work as a Analytics Specialist Manager at Amazon Web Services.

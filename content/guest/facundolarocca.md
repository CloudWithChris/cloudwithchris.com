I started coding in C# and using Microsoft's technologies when I was 17. Since then I have been working with Microsoft's stack and I love it.
In the last almost four years, I have been digging into Distributing Computing, and particularly into Cloud ecosystems, a matter I am passionate about.
I am actually working part of the time with Azure stack and part with Google Cloud stack, which helped me understand Azure is by far the best Cloud provider available.

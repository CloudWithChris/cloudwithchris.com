As a Cloud Solution Architect with Microsoft, I act as a trusted advisor for our highly valued customers and partners. I engage with them from pre-sales, through architecture design, proof of concept and design during implementation phase. I also have experience as a Technical Architect and Team Lead.

I am passionate about new technologies, trying to evaluate their proâ€™s and cons and thus keeping a realistic view on the different possibilities.

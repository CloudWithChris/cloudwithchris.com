Description: "Chris is the blogger, podcaster, host and producer of his content platform CloudWithChris.com.
He uses GitHub to manage, develop, build and deploy it.
In this session, Chris explores how GitHub is more than just a Git repository, and how he uses it for his own work:

GitHub Issues / Projects to plan the content (Blog & Podcast) backlog
GitHub repositories to version control the website's source code (and recently open sourced the theme)
GitHub Codespaces to make changes to the site from any device
GitHub actions to build/deploy the site, and publish podcast mp3 files"

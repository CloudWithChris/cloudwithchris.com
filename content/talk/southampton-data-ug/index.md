Description: "GitHub is just that tool which developers use on Open Source projects, right? Not quite!
You could be using Github in your day-to-day work. Have you thought about storing your SQL scripts, or machine learning workbooks in Git repositories? How about checking the quality of the content that you've version controlled? Or thinking about the security of your project? These are all things that GitHub can help with! Join Chris in this session as he provides a holistic overview for data professionals on GitHub, GitHub Enterprise and GitHub Advanced Security."

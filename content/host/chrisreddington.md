Chris is  trying his hand at a new skill, improv! He has recently attended an intensive workshop with The Showstoppers, and is continuing to refine his skills with What's the game Improv! His vision is to merge the two areas together, and form a Musical Improv group in Reading, called [Theatreers](https://www.theatreers.com) - though this is a work in progress!

Description: The event sourcing pattern is a well-known pattern and has been around
  for some time. The idea is that you use an append-only store to record the full
  series of actions taken on the data. This combines well with the materialized view
  pattern, where a pre-populated view is generated over one (or more) data stores
  when the data isn't in an ideal format for querying. These two patterns are common
  patterns used in an event-driven architecture. Join Chris and Steph as they talk
  about both of these patterns and how they may be able to help. This is another episode
  in the series of Architecting for the Cloud, one pattern at a time.

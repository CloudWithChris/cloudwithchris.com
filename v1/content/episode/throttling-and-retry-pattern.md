Description: How are you thinking about handling load on your application, scaling
  out perhaps? But what about if you're building a multi-tenant service and worried
  about safeguarding resources on a per tenant basis? What happens if there's a temporary
  blip, and there are issues that impact the stability of the application? Then tune
  in to this episode where Chris is joined by John Downs, talking about the Throttling,
  Retry and Circuit Breaker Patterns. This is another episode in the series of Architecting
  for the Cloud, one pattern at a time.
